# React News $horts 
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  This is our attempt at building a news shorts website
</td>

## Important Note
For some reason, News API only works on mozilla browsers in free plan other than that -
News api doesn't allow you to fetch the api from a deployed site. You can fork this repo and run in your local server and add your apikey in config.js file in the root.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo : 


## Built with 

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
